## Amazon S3 Gst Plugin

A collection of [GStreamer](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/) elements to interact
with the [Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3)](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/).

## Getting started
### Setting up dependencies
Following dependencies are required to build the project:
 * [GStreamer](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/): [core](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/gstreamer/gstreamer), [base plugins](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/gstreamer/gst-plugins-base)  
 see the [GStreamer's documentation](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/documentation/installing/index.html?gi-language=c) for installation instructions
 * [Meson build system](https://mesonbuild.com/)
 * [AWS SDK for C++](https://aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-cpp/)

### Building the project
```bash
$ meson build
$ cd build
$ ninja
$ sudo ninja install
```
After executing commands above, the plugin (`libgsts3elements.so`) should be installed in the default GStreamer's plugin path. It can also be found in the build directory, and used by specifying the plugin path:
```bash 
$ GST_PLUGIN_PATH=src gst-inspect-1.0 s3sink
```

## Elements
* s3sink - streams the multimedia to a specified bucket.

## AWS Credentials
By default all the elements use the [default credentials provider chain](https://sdk.amazonaws.com/cpp/api/0.14.3/class_aws_1_1_auth_1_1_default_a_w_s_credentials_provider_chain.html), which means, that credentials are read from the following sources:

1. Environment variables: `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
1. AWS credentials file. Usually located at ~/.aws/credentials.
1. For EC2 instance, IAM instance profile.

Some of the elements have `credentials` property of `GstAWSCredentials` type, which is a wrapper for an `Aws::Auth::AWSCredentialsProvider` class.

### Defining GstAWSCredentials as a string
The `GstAWSCredentials` object can be deserialized from a string, which makes using the property in gst-launch command possible. The string must be specified in the following format
```
property1=value1[|property2=value2[|property3=value3[|...]]]
```
Currently the deserializer accepts following properties:

* `access-key-id`, e.g. `AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE`
* `secret-access-key`, e.g. `wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY`
* `session-token`
* `iam-role`, e.g. `arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/s3access`

All the properties are optional, however, be aware of the rules:

* `access-key-id` cannot exist without `secret-access-key` (and vice versa)
* if `session-token` specified, both `access-key-id` and `secret-access-key` must be present
* if `iam-role` is specified, it will use default credentials provider to assume the role, unless `access-key-id` and `secret-access-key` are present - in that case, these credentials are used to assume the role.

## Examples
* Streaming camera capture to an S3 bucket:
```
$ gst-launch-1.0 -e v4l2src num-buffers=300 device=/dev/video0 ! x264enc ! matroskamux ! s3sink bucket=my-personal-videos key=recording.mkv
```
